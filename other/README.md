# Code Quality
Software quality metrics: Cohesion and Coupling. How easily your code can be changed or extended

**Cohesion** is the degree to wich elements of a certain class or function belong together.
**Coupling** is a measure of how dependent two parts of your code. The more coupling you introduce the more diffuclt becomes to maintain your code.
